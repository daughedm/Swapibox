# SwAPI Box

Swapi Box is an app designed to display data from the the Star Wars universe.  It has functionality, that allows users to browse through different categories of things in the Star Wars universe like people, planets and vehicles.  Users are also able to grab and save cards to their favorites for later viewing. The main purpose of this project was to get us familiar with using, cleaning and traversing data from an API.
